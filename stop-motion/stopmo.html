	<p>In class, we had to create a mobile application by group of 3 in a short period of 1 month. The brief was to revitalize the practise of Ping-Pong by finding new concept to approach in a new way this sport. With my group we created an application to challenge our friends with different little defies in the city and find new spots to play Ping-Pong and share it with the application community. I designed the application interfaces and then we made a concept video to present our project and our prototype.</p>
