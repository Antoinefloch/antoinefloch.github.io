	<p>NÃ©o juice is an exhibition that I organized with two friends of mine. We wanted to create an event, which gather 20 friends artist from different design school in Nantes and Paris. We ask them to produce from 1 to 4 prints each and a visual in black that we printed silk-screen printing on T-shirts ans sweatshirts then we sold them during the exhibition. This project was totally independant from school.</p>
